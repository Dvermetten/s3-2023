- In the `documents` folder you can find the slides of the "Modelling
  Optimisation Problems" presentation given during the summer school,
  and the project statement, which includes the description of the
  problems and the modelling API documentation.
- In the `src` folder you can find all the code, including the API
  code, a simple TSP example model, and several evaluators to validate
  solutions obtained for the problems.
- In the `data` folder you can find some problem instances that you
  can use to test the models.
